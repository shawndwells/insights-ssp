<div class="usa-accordion-bordered">
  <button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button"

    Documentation
  </button>
  <div id="documentation" class="usa-accordion-content">
    <h4 class="usa-heading">Accessibility</h4>
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
      <li>
        Code header areas in the accordion as <code>&lt;buttons&gt;</code> so that they are usable with both screen readers and the keyboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buttons should state if they are expanded with <code>aria-expanded=<wbr>"true"</code>. The <code>aria-expanded=<wbr>"false"</code> attributes will be added to other buttons when the accordion is initialized by the JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each button has a unique name <code>aria-controls=<wbr>"id"</code> that associates the control to the appropriate region by referencing the controlled element&rsquo;s <code>id</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each content area will have its <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute set to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> by the component, depending on its corresponding button&rsquo;s <code>aria-expanded</code> attribute. To ensure that your content is accessible in the event that the JavaScript does not load or is disabled, you should not set <code>aria-hidden=<wbr>"true"</code> on any of your content areas.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="usa-heading">Usability</h4>
    <h5>When to use</h5>
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
      <li>Users only need a few specific pieces of content within a page.</li>
      <li>Information needs to be displayed in a small space.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>When to consider something else</h5>
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
      <li>If visitors need to see most or all of the information on a page. Use well-formatted text instead.</li>
      <li>If there is not enough content to warrant condensing. Accordions increase cognitive load and interaction cost, as users have to make decisions about what headers to click on.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Guidance</h5>
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
      <li>Allow users to click anywhere in the header area to expand or collapse the content; a larger target is easier to manipulate.</li>
      <li>Make sure interactive elements within the collapsible region are far enough from the headers that users donâ€™t accidentally trigger a collapse. (The exact distance depends on the device.)</li>
    </ul>
