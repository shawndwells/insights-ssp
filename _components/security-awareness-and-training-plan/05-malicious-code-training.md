A well-maintained workforce provides another organizational safeguard that can
be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect the organization
against malicious code via email or web applications. Personnel are trained to
look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an
unexpected email, receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving
an email from an unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor
or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how to respond to such suspicious
email or web communications (e.g., not opening attachments, not clicking
on embedded web links, and checking the source of email addresses). For this
process to work effectively, all organizational personnel are trained and made
aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how
to recognize anomalous behaviors in organizational information systems can
potentially provide early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition
of such anomalous behavior by organizational personnel can supplement automated
malicious code detection and protection tools and systems employed by the
organization.

DISA's [DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge](http://iatraining.disa.mil/eta/cyberchallenge/launchpage.htm) contains the modules that meed the DoD requirement for malicious code training.
