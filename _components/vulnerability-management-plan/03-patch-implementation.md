The system owner, upon receipt of an official notification of a vulnerability
notice, will take the following actions:

1. Access the DoD-CERT web page and retrieve the entire vulnerability notice message.
2. Notify SA, ISSO, and all appropriate staff of the vulnerability notice and inform the staff to access the DoD-CERT web page and retrieve the vulnerability notice message.
3. Acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability notification to the SMDC IAM. Acknowledgement must be completed within 5 days unless otherwise specified in the vulnerability notification.
4. Assess the impact of the vulnerability, apply the fix or obtain an extension if corrective actions cannot be implemented within the specified timeframe. Report the status for each vulnerability notice as it applies to every applicable asset within the information system.
5. Conduct random compliance checks on information system assets to validate the information being reported through the command channels.

Information system owners can opt to make a vulnerability notice requirement more stringent than those required by DoD CERT.
