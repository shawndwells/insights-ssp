title: Patch Extension Request
parent: vmp
order: 04
---
Should timely patching not be feasible, extensions are granted by the
organization's Designated Approving Authority (DAA). The following
considerations must be documented for each extension request:

- The assessment of risk (e.g.; how vulnerable the system is to exploit)
- How the system(s) will be monitored for exploitation (e.g.; use of mitigating tools)
- A Fix Action Plan with a completion date
