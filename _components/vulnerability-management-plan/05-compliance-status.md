Every asset potentially affected by a vulnerability notice will be labeled
with one of the following "Compliance Status" identifies:

**Open**: "Open" means the asset is impacted by a specific alert; however, no
protective actions have been put in place. As a result, the vulnerability still
exists. Most alerts are issued with a period of 30 days for compliance. An "open"
status is acceptable during this 30-60 day period. However, if an asset becomes
operational 30 days after the initial release of the alert, an "open" status is
not acceptable.

**Not Applicable**: "Not applicable" means the System Administrator (SA),
Information System Security Officer (ISSO), Information System Security Manager
(ISSM) or Program Manager (PM) has determined a recently released alert does not
apply to the operational configuration of an asset. The responsible user who
made this decision is required to maintain all documentation to justify the
"Not Applicable" status. The management hierarchy or the DAA may request the
documentation. Also, the documentation may be reviewed during the compliance
validation process.

**Fixed/In Compliance**: This status means the SA or ISSO has determined an
asset is applicable to a recently released alert and is in compliance with the
official patch or fix.

**Extension Requested**: "Extension Requested" indicates that an extension
request has been submitted for the asset and is in the process of being
reviewed. There are two types of extension requests. First, the extension can be
used in the traditional sense where the DAA accepts the mitigated risk associated
with nonstandard official corrective action. Second, the extension can be employed
by the user to request additional time to allow for corrective action to occur.
This would be used for situations where corrective action cannot be implemented
within the specified timeframe due to other factors (e.g.; equipment delivery,
financial limitations, resource shortage, PMO actions, and other prerequisite
tasks).

**Extension Approved**: This status indicates that an extension request has been
approved for a specified timeframe. Management is responsible for continuing to
address the problem and ensure that mitigating controls are in place. An
extension may be granted for extended periods with management involvement. See list below.

| Period | Number of Days | Management | Fix Action Plan Requirement |
|--------|----------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| Original Compliance Period | 30 < original time period | IAM | * EMail tickler sent 15 days prior to compliance date polling activity fix status<br /><br />* If asset will be in compliance - No action required.<br /><br />* If asset will not be in compliance - IAM must submit a consolidated activity Plan of Action and Milestones (POA*M) to CIO 7 days prior to compliance date|
| 1st Extension | Not to exceed 30 days | IAM, DAA | * EMail tickler sent 15 days prior to compliance date polling activity fix status.<br /><br />* If asset will be in compliance - No action required.<br /><br />* If asset will not be in compliance - IAM must submit a consolidated activity Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to CIO 7 days prior to extension expiration.|
| 2nd Extension | Not to exceed 60 days | IAM, DAA | * EMail tickler sent at 15-day intervals for compliance status check.|
| Additional Extensions (if required) | Based on circumstances | DAA | TBD |

**Extension Denied**: This status indicates that the Designated Approval
Authority evaluated and denied an extension request. The SA/ISSO is responsible
for immediately implementing corrective actions.

**Extension Expired**: This status indicates that an approved extension has
expired for the asset and that corrective actions must be implemented or that
another extension request must be submitted.
