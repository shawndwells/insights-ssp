        'There are three types of Tower users that can be assigned:

        - Normal User
        Normal Users have read and write access limited to the resources
        (such as inventory, projects, and job templates) for which that user
        has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges.

        - System Auditor
        Auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects
        within the Tower environment.

        - System Adminisrator
        A Tower System Administrator (also known as a Superuser) has admin,
        read, and write privileges over the entire Tower installation. A
        System Administrator is typically responsible for managing all
        aspects of Tower and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day
        work to various Users.

        Ansible Tower uses role-based access control to provide the ability
        to read, modify, and administer projects, inventories, job templates,
        and other Ansible Tower elements. The role-based access control policies
        can be defined per-user, or per user type as indicated above.

        Additional detail can be found in the Ansible Tower documentation:

        https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/users.html'

        'Ansible Tower does not currently have the capability to enforce limits
        on consecutive logon attempts.

        To satisfy this control an external authentication service, such
        as Red Hat IdM, must be used. This control is not applicable to
        Ansible Tower when an external authentication service is used.'

        'Ansible Tower does not currently have the capability automatically
        lock an account for an organizationally-defined time period, nor
        does Ansible Tower have the capability to lock an account until
        released by an administrator.

        To satisfy those elemenets of this control an external
        authentication service, such as Red Hat IdM, must be used.
        Those two elements of this control are not applicable to
        Ansible Tower when an external authentication service
        is used.

        Ansible Tower does not currently have the ability to delay
        logon prompts according to an organizationally-defined delay
        algorithm when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is
        exceeded. Ansible Tower cannot be configured to perform
        this functionality; delay of further logon prompts is a permanent
        finding.'
