   (4)(b).  Show via [Selection: informal demonstration, convincing argument with formal methods as feasible] that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
   (4)(c).  Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification completely  covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;
   (4)(d).  Show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and
   (4)(e).  Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the descriptive top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware."
