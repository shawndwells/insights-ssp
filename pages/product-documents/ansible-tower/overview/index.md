## Common Criteria
Ansible Tower has not undergone Common Criteria certification. A future certification
against the [NIAP Protection Profile for Application Software](https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=394&id=394) is being considered.

To help Red Hat track demand for a Common Criteria certification of Ansible Tower, please <a href="https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new">open a customer support case</a> requesting a certification.

## FIPS 140-2
Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 is a legal requirement ensuring cryptographic tools implement algorithms properly. Vendors must certify their cryptographic implementations through NIST's [Cryptographic Module Validation Program](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program).

FIPS 140-2 validation does not constitute an entire product. Rather, underlying cryptographic
subsystems or components, such as OpenSSL and OpenSSH, are validated. 

When Ansible Tower runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x, the following FIPS 140-2 validations
are retained:

| Product | Component | Version | NIST Certificate | Status | Sunset/Expiration? |
|:--------|:----------|:-------:|:----------------:|:------:|:------------------:|
