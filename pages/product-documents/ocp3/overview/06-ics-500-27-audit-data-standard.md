## Auditable Events or Activities
test

### Authentication Events
#### Logons (Success/Failure)
OpenShift Container Platform 3.x does not currently have the capability
to audit successful user logon events.

Failed logon attempts will be audited to ``/var/log/tower``. A sample audit record is shown below:

`````
tower.log:309:2018-06-28 21:05:52,309 WARNING  awx.api.views Login failed for user admin
`````

#### Logoffs (Success/Failure)
OpenShift Container Platform 3.x does not currently have the capability to
audit user logoff events.

### File & Object Events
#### Create (Success/Failure)
Objects created within OpenShift Container Platform 3.x will generate audit
events in the Activity Steam. Specifically, the
``"operation": "create"`` data field will identify created
objects.

A sample audit event record demonstrating the ``admin``
user successfully creating a new Tower Inventory, ``New Inventory``
is shown below:

#### Access (Success/Failure)
#### Delete (Success/Failure)
Objects created within OpenShift Container Platform 3.x will generate audit
events in the Activity Steam. Specifically, the
``"operation": "delete"`` data field will identify created
objects.

A sample audit event record demonstrating the ``admin``
user successfully deleting a Tower Inventory, ``New Inventory``
is shown below:
