OpenStack Platform 13 overview

## Common Criteria
OpenStack Platform 13 has not undergone Common Criteria certification. A future certification
against the [NIAP Protection Profile for Application Software](https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=394&id=394) is being considered.

To help Red Hat track demand for a Common Criteria certification of OpenStack Platform 13, please open a
customer support case requesting an evaluation.

## FIPS 140-2
Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 is a legal requirement ensuring cryptographic tools implement algorithms properly. Vendors must certify their cryptographic implementations through NIST's [Cryptographic Module Validation Program](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program).

FIPS 140-2 validation does not constitute an entire product. Rather, underlying cryptographic
subsystems or components, such as OpenSSL and OpenSSH, are validated. 

When OpenStack Platform 13 runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x, the following FIPS 140-2 validations
are retained:

| Product | Component | Version | NIST Certificate | Status | Sunset/Expiration? |
