lead: While many programs maintain their own unique brand identities, the Design System offers a common visual style that you can flexibly apply to a range of government digital platforms. Our visual style offers a clean, modern aesthetic that meets high standards of visual accessibility while promoting credibility, trust, and warmth in the design.

We expect many teams will need to customize this guide, but we encourage you to incorporate as much consistency in look, feel, and usability as you can.

As a complement to this visual style guidance, we strongly recommend you use [18F’s Content Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/) when writing language for government services.

## Design resources

The site contains HTML mockups of common UI components designed to follow the U.S. Web Design System’s visual style guide. To view the specs of each design live on this website (padding, margins, stroke weight, line-height, and so on), use your browser’s developer tools.

All of these designs are also available in various file formats, which are available for download:

### Retired design files
The following design files are no longer being maintained by the U.S. Web Design System team as of version 1.0.0. The most recent versions remain available for download at the links below. While the Design System team is no longer maintaining these files, we'd love to hear from any teams that are using these files and adding new components when new versions of the Design System is released.

## Notes on accessibility

All of our designs meet the [WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and are compliant with [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](http://www.section508.gov/). If you choose to customize these designs, please make sure they continue to meet the requirements listed in the “Accessibility” section of each design.
