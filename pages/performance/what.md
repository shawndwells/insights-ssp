Web performance generally refers to how quickly a URL loads and appears in a web browser. Sites are considered to have good performance if they load quickly and allow users to easily interact with them. Sites with poor performance typically have slow, or halting, page loads and interaction delays, which may prevent users from accessing your content or using your web applications.

Many factors affect web performance, such as: network speeds, physical distances between server and client, relative speeds of the server and client computers, and — as we've chosen to focus on in this guide — specific technical aspects of the site itself.
